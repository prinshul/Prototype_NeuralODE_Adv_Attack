## Installation and setup

To install this repository and its dependent packages, run the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/pnodemiccai/PNODE-FSS.git
cd PNODE-FSS
conda create --name PNODE-FSS # (optional, for making a conda environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change the paths to BCV, CT-ORG and Decathlon datasets in  `config.py` and  `test_config.py` according to paths on your local. Also change the path to ImageNet pretrained VGG model weights in these files.

Trained model weights for PNODE, AT-PANet and all baselines on relevant settings can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q6ksoDqHKUf6MmksHqCsABtKvdK9btpM?usp=sharing).

Processed datasets of BCV, CT-ORG and Decathlon can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lvnV0XVluyHm2NZAUecYknpaxbzD2nNo?usp=sharing).

Implementations of baseline FSS methods used in this repository are adapted from [here](https://github.com/oopil/3D_medical_image_FSS).

## Training

To train baseline methods, go to their respective folders and run

```
python3 train.py with model_name=<save-name> target=<test-target> n_shot=<shot>
```


For  AT-PANet, run `train_adversarial.py` from PANet folder with the same  arguments as before.


For  PNODE, some extra arguments are needed. To train  PNODE,  run

```
python3 train.py with model_name=<save-name> target=<test-target> n_shot=<shot> ode_layers=3 ode_time=4
```


## Testing

To train baseline methods, go to their respective folders and run

```
python3 test_attacked.py with snapshot=<weights-path> target=<test-target> dataset=<BCV/CTORG/Decathlon> attack=<Clean/FGSM/PGD/SMIA> attack_eps=<eps> to_attack=<q/s>
```

This command can be used for testing all  models on all settings, namely 1-shot and 3-shot, liver  and  spleen and Clean, FGSM, PGD and SMIA with different epsilons. 


### Class Mapping

```
BCV:
    Liver: 6
    Spleen: 1
CT-ORG: 
    Liver: 1
Decathlon: 
    Liver: 2
    Spleen: 6
```
